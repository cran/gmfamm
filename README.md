The goal of gmfamm is to provide a new family for the
[bamlss](http://www.bamlss.org/) package, which allows to model
generalized multivariate functional data. The functions already work and
additional documentation will be added.

## Installation

You can install the release version of gmfamm from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gmfamm) with:

``` r
install.packages("gmfamm")
```
